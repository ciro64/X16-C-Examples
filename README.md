# X16 C Examples

The goal of this repository is to provide C examples for the Commander X16 for interacting with low level stuff in a intuitive way. The compiler used is [CC65](https://cc65.github.io/getting-started.html).

Disclaimer: I'm a newcomer and this repository is under development.

## Compiling
### sprites.c
```
./png2sprite.py -n arrow_data arrow.png arrow_data.inc
cl65 -t cx16 -O -o sprites.prg sprites.c
```
## Running
You can test the examples with the following commands using the [Commander X16 emulator](https://github.com/commanderx16/x16-emulator):
```
EMULATOR_PATH/x16emu -prg FILENAME.prg -run -scale 2 -quality nearest
```

## Todo
* ~~Sprites~~
